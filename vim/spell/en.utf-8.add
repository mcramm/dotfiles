The goblin was a little surprised at the question. "Oh, that? That was a pepper bomb. It's useful when you want to blind your opponents and not do any lasting damage to them." the goblin replied. He looked over his shoulder at Frank. "The intent was to get them to run away," he added.
Anastasia continued running, and eventually exited the clouds. The light from her horn dissipated as if it had a mind of its own. She rounded a sharp corner and found herself at the mountaintop. Straight ahead of her was a series of tall conical rocks with pointed tips arranged in two rows. The path led straight between them towards an almost blinding white light. She galloped towards it, and as she approached her eyes adjusted. The glow was coming from the inside of a glittering translucent diamond whose edges and internal structure was highlighted with dark, black lines. The diamond hovered just off the ground and was rotating slowly. Anastasia drew closer to the diamond and began to hear a crowd of whispers. The whispers frightened her, so closed her eyes and lowered her horn, charging straight for the diamond. The whispers grew in volume, and she could finally understand what they were saying.

The group wandered down the path for a while until Bronzebutt directed them down a small fork that led south. The others didn't even notice it until he pointed it out. The path angled down for a while, and they began to see more and more dead plants that had been touched by evil magic.
She was pacing back and forth, unsure of what to do next, when she remembered her friends. Anastasia ran around to the back of the tower, and over to the bushes where they had agreed to meet after. No one was there. Anastasia looked at the ground and saw that it was littered with small goblin-like footprints.  There seemed to have been a lot of them here recently, which meant that maybe some of her friends *had* tired to come back here, but had been captured. The tracks lead back to the tower, so Anastasia followed them. They led back to the fire, where she had been lying, then back to the west, down a path that the goblin tribe must use when traveling to the tower. In the dirt next to the fire, Anastasia saw the print of a bear, and was sure then, that her friends had been captured.

Clio's data schema - how data is organized in the database - isn't trivial, which means the process by which we obfuscate that data isn't trivial. It is, in fact, very complicated, and requires background jobs that run for days at a time. I was working on a fix in a related area, and needed to know how this obfuscation process was working in order to ensure that I didn't break something. Screwing something up here could have serious consequences for the company.
